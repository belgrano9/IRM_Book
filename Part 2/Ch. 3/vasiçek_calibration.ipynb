    "In this report, we present three methods for calibrating the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, commonly known as the Vasicek model, to a dataset of interest rates. We will also perform a sensitivity analysis to understand how changes in the model parameters affect the model's performance.\n",

    "### Sensitivity Analysis: Understanding the Impact of Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The sensitivity analysis aims to understand how small changes in the parameters \\( $\\lambda$, $\\mu$, \\) and \\( $\\sigma$ \\) affect the behavior of the Vasicek model. This is crucial for calibration, risk management, and pricing of financial derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sensitivity to \\( $\\lambda$ \\) (Mean Reversion Rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "The perturbed process for \\( $\\lambda$ \\) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{r}_{t+\\delta t} = r_t + [\\lambda + \\Delta \\lambda](\\mu - r_t) \\delta t + \\sigma \\sqrt{\\delta t} \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the perturbed and original processes is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{r}_{t+\\delta t} - r_{t+\\delta t} = \\Delta \\lambda (\\mu - r_t) \\delta t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As \\( $\\lambda$ \\) increases, the variance \\( $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\lambda}$ \\) decreases. The parameter \\( $\\lambda$ \\) affects how quickly the interest rate reverts to its long-term mean \\( $\\mu$ \\), but it does not affect the long-term mean itself. Therefore, \\( $\\lambda$ \\) is particularly important for pricing financial instruments sensitive to volatility but not to the long-term expected value of the interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sensitivity to \\( $\\mu$ \\) (Long-term Mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "The perturbed process for \\( $\\mu$ \\) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{r}_{t+\\delta t} = r_t + \\lambda ([\\mu + \\Delta \\mu] - r_t) \\delta t + \\sigma \\sqrt{\\delta t} \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{r}_{t+\\delta t} - r_{t+\\delta t} = \\lambda (\\Delta \\mu - r_t) \\delta t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A change in \\( $\\mu$ \\) shifts the long-term mean to which the rate reverts. This is crucial for instruments that are sensitive to the long-term level of interest rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sensitivity to \\( $\\sigma$ \\) (Volatility)\n",
    "\n",
    "The perturbed process for \\( $\\sigma$ \\) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde{r}_{t+\\delta t} = r_t + \\lambda (\\mu - r_t) \\delta t + [\\sigma + \\Delta \\sigma] \\sqrt{\\delta t} \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{r}_{t+\\delta t} - r_{t+\\delta t} = \\Delta \\sigma \\sqrt{\\delta t} \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the long term, a change in \\( $\\sigma$ \\) does not affect the expected value of the interest rate, but it does affect its variance. This is important for pricing options and other derivatives that are sensitive to volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    " The analysis shows that \\( $\\lambda$ \\) is crucial for instruments sensitive to volatility, \\( $\\mu$ \\) is important for those sensitive to the long-term level of interest rates, and \\( $\\sigma$ \\) is vital for options and other derivatives that are sensitive to both."
