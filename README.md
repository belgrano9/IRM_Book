# Mathematical Finance Models from Brigo & Mercurio

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of selected financial models from Damiano Brigo and Fabio Mercurio's seminal book on mathematical finance. The aim is to provide a rigorous, yet accessible, computational framework for pricing, hedging, and risk management of financial derivatives.

## Features

- **Theoretical Foundations**: Detailed documentation elucidating the mathematical formulations, assumptions, and limitations of each model.
  
- **Mathematical Formalism**: Rigorous mathematical treatment of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), boundary conditions, and calibration methods.

- **Python Implementation**: High-quality Python code leveraging libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and QuantLib for numerical solutions.

- **Validation and Testing**: Comprehensive test suites and validation against historical financial data.

- **Optimization**: Performance-optimized algorithms for computationally intensive tasks.
